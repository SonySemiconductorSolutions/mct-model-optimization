## Introduction

Export your quantized model in the following serialization formats:

* TensorFlow models can be exported as Tensorflow models (`.h5` extension) and TFLite models (`.tflite` extension).
* PyTorch models can be exported as torch script models and ONNX models (`.onnx` extension).

You can export your quantized model in the following quantization formats:
* Fake Quant (where weights and activations are float fakely-quantized values)
* INT8 (where weights and activations are represented using 8bits integers)

The quantization format value set in the target platform (an edge device with dedicated hardware).
For more details, please read the [TPC README](../target_platform_capabilities/README.md).  
```python
import model_compression_toolkit as mct
from model_compression_toolkit.target_platform_capabilities.target_platform.quantization_format import \
    QuantizationFormat

tp = mct.target_platform

def define_tpc(hardware_config, hardware_name):
    hardware_configuration_options = tp.QuantizationConfigOptions([hardware_config])
    # Define target platform model
    hardware_tpc = tp.TargetPlatformModel(hardware_configuration_options, name=hardware_name)
    
    # Set the QuantizationFormat suits the hardware: QuantizationFormat.FAKELY_QUANT or QuantizationFormat.INT8
    with hardware_tpc:
        hardware_tpc.set_quantization_format(QuantizationFormat.FAKELY_QUANT)
```

## Export TensorFlow Models

To export a TensorFlow model - a quantized model from MCT should be quantized first:

```python
import numpy as np
from keras.applications import ResNet50
import model_compression_toolkit as mct

# Create a model
float_model = ResNet50()
# Quantize the model. In order to export the model set new_experimental_exporter to True.
# Notice that here the representative dataset is random. 
quantized_exportable_model, _ = mct.ptq.keras_post_training_quantization_experimental(float_model,
                                                                                      representative_data_gen=lambda: [
                                                                                          np.random.random(
                                                                                              (1, 224, 224, 3))],
                                                                                      new_experimental_exporter=True)
```

### TFLite
The tflite serialization format export in two qauntization formats 

#### INT8 TFLite

The model will be exported as a tflite model where weights and activations are represented as 8bit integers.

##### Usage Example

```python
import tempfile
# In order ro the exporter will export an int8 model, the TPC must be configured using the appropriate 
# quantization format
from mct.target_platform_capabilities.tpc_models.tflite_tpc.latest import get_keras_tpc_latest
from mct.exporter.model_exporter.keras.export_serialization_format import KerasExportSerializationFormat

# Path of exported model
_, tflite_file_path = tempfile.mkstemp('.tflite')

# Get TPC
tflite_int8_tpc = get_keras_tpc_latest()

# Use mode KerasExportSerializationFormat.TFLITE for tflite model and tflite keras tpc for INT8 data type.
mct.exporter.keras_export_model(model=quantized_exportable_model, save_model_path=tflite_file_path,
                                target_platform_capabilities=tflite_int8_tpc,
                                serialization_format=KerasExportSerializationFormat.TFLITE)
```

Compare size of float and quantized model:

```python
import os

# Save float model to measure its size
_, float_file_path = tempfile.mkstemp('.h5')
float_model.save(float_file_path)

print("Float model in Mb:", os.path.getsize(float_file_path) / float(2 ** 20))
print("Quantized model in Mb:", os.path.getsize(tflite_file_path) / float(2 ** 20))
print(f'Compression ratio: {os.path.getsize(float_file_path) / os.path.getsize(tflite_file_path)}')
```

#### Fakely-Quantized TFLite

The model will be exported as a tflite model where weights and activations are quantized but represented as float.
Notice that activation quantizers are implemented
using [tf.quantization.fake_quant_with_min_max_vars](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/quantization/fake_quant_with_min_max_vars)
operators.

##### Usage Example

```python

from mct.target_platform_capabilities.tpc_models.default_tpc.latest import get_keras_tpc_latest
from mct.exporter.model_exporter.keras.export_serialization_format import KerasExportSerializationFormat

# Path of exported model
_, tflite_file_path = tempfile.mkstemp('.tflite')

# Get TPC
keras_tpc = get_keras_tpc_latest()

# Use mode KerasExportSerializationFormat.TFLITE for tflite model and keras tpc for fakely-quantized weights 
# and activations
mct.exporter.keras_export_model(model=quantized_exportable_model,
                                save_model_path=tflite_file_path,
                                target_platform_capabilities=keras_tpc,
                                serialization_format=KerasExportSerializationFormat.TFLITE)
```

Notice that the fakely-quantized model has the same size as the quantized exportable model as weights data types are
float.

### H5

The model will be exported as a tensorflow `.h5` model where weights and activations are quantized but represented as
float (fakely quant).

#### Usage Example

```python
import tempfile

from mct.target_platform_capabilities.tpc_models.default_tpc.latest import get_keras_tpc_latest
from mct.exporter.model_exporter.keras.export_serialization_format import KerasExportSerializationFormat

# Path of exported model
_, h5_file_path = tempfile.mkstemp('.h5')

# Get TPC
keras_tpc = get_keras_tpc_latest()

# Use mode KerasExportSerializationFormat.KERAS_H5 for keras h5 model and default keras tpc for fakely-quantized weights 
# and activations
mct.exporter.keras_export_model(model=quantized_exportable_model, save_model_path=h5_file_path,
                                target_platform_capabilities=keras_tpc,
                                serialization_format=KerasExportSerializationFormat.KERAS_H5)
```

Notice that the fakely-quantized model has the same size as the quantized exportable model as weights data types are
float.

## Export PyTorch models

To export a PyTorch model - a quantized model from MCT should be quantized first:

```python
import model_compression_toolkit as mct
import numpy as np
import torch
from torchvision.models.mobilenetv2 import mobilenet_v2

# Create a model
float_model = mobilenet_v2()


# Quantize the model. In order to export the model set new_experimental_exporter to True.
# Notice that here the representative dataset is random.
def representative_data_gen():
    for i in range(1):
        yield [np.random.random((1, 3, 224, 224))]


quantized_exportable_model, _ = mct.ptq.pytorch_post_training_quantization_experimental(float_model,
                                                                                    representative_data_gen=representative_data_gen,
                                                                                    new_experimental_exporter=True)
```

### ONNX

The model will be exported in ONNX format where weights and activations are quantized but represented as float 
(fakely quant).

#### Usage Example

```python
import tempfile

from mct.target_platform_capabilities.tpc_models.default_tpc.latest import get_pytorch_tpc_latest
from mct.exporter.model_exporter.pytorch.export_serialization_format import PytorchExportSerializationFormat

# Path of exported model
_, onnx_file_path = tempfile.mkstemp('.onnx')

# Get TPC
pytorch_tpc = get_pytorch_tpc_latest()

# Use mode PytorchExportSerializationFormat.ONNX for keras h5 model and default pytorch tpc for fakely-quantized weights 
# and activations
mct.exporter.pytorch_export_model(model=quantized_exportable_model, save_model_path=onnx_file_path,
                                  repr_dataset=representative_data_gen, target_platform_capabilities=pytorch_tpc,
                                  serialization_format=PytorchExportSerializationFormat.ONNX)
```

Notice that the fakely-quantized model has the same size as the quantized exportable model as weights data types are
float.

### TorchScript

The model will be exported in TorchScript format where weights and activations are quantized but represented as float 
(fakely quant).

#### Usage Example

```python
import tempfile

from mct.target_platform_capabilities.tpc_models.default_tpc.latest import get_pytorch_tpc_latest
from mct.exporter.model_exporter.pytorch.export_serialization_format import PytorchExportSerializationFormat

# Path of exported model
_, torchscript_file_path = tempfile.mkstemp('.pt')

# Get TPC
pytorch_tpc = get_pytorch_tpc_latest()

# Use mode PytorchExportSerializationFormat.TORCHSCRIPT for keras h5 model and default pytorch tpc for fakely-quantized weights 
# and activations
mct.exporter.pytorch_export_model(model=quantized_exportable_model, save_model_path=torchscript_file_path,
                                  repr_dataset=representative_data_gen, target_platform_capabilities=pytorch_tpc,
                                  serialization_format=PytorchExportSerializationFormat.TORCHSCRIPT)
```

Notice that the fakely-quantized model has the same size as the quantized exportable model as weights data types are
float.
