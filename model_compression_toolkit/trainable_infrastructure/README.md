# Quantizers Infrastructure (QI)

Quantizers infrastructure is a module containing quantization abstraction and quantizers for hardware-oriented model optimization tools such as the Model Compression Toolkit ([MCT](https://github.com/sony/model_optimization)).

It provides the required abstraction for emulating inference-time quantization and trainable quantization methods such as quantization-aware training.

## High level description

For each layer, we use a "Quantization Wrapper" to wrap the layer, the weights quantizers, and the activation quantizers. We can choose the quantizers and all the quantization information for each layer by initializing the weights_quantizer and activation_quantizer API.

Notice that the quantization wrapper and the quantizers are per framework.

## Quantizers 
The quantizers in this module are divided into two main types:
The "Inferable Quantizer" is used for emulating inference-time quantization, and the "Trainable Quantizer", contains learnable quantization parameters that can be optimized during training.
